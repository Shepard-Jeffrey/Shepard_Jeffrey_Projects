# Apollo

Apollo is a web based forensics tool used to recover information from solid state drives. Right now it only works on certain types of virtual drives, but nevertheless data recovery on SSDs is generally known to be extremely difficult and this is progress. 

This was created in a group with others as part of a school Capstone Project. I worked on research into methods and front-end development.
