My demo work in Computer Science

The "Unity Demo" folder has the code of a simple game I made in unity, the music is not mine. 
Alternatively, you can view/play the game by going to https://shepard-jeffrey.github.io/Shepard_Jeffrey_Projects/Unity_Demo/

Apollo is a web based forensics tool used to recover information from solid state drives, this was completed in a group for a Capstone Project course.
